well as guidelines for adding your own functionalities.

Functionalities (Blocks)
------------------------

Data plotting
+++++++++++++

  Useful for plotting curves made of two labels from different blocks, as the
  timestamps of the data points would otherwise never match. Also used before
  saving data to ease post-processing.

  playing the same role as a dot.

  No example featuring a Disve block is currently distributed.

- :ref:`GPU VE`
