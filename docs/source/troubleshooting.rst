Troubleshooting
===============

When encountering a problem with Crappy, please **first carefully read the**
**present documentation**. Most of the difficulties users may face come from an
incorrect use of Crappy. If you cannot find an answer in the documentation, you
can then **check if a similar problem was brought up by users** in the
`Issues <https://github.com/LaboratoireMecaniqueLille/crappy/issues>`_ and
`Discussions <https://github.com/LaboratoireMecaniqueLille/crappy/discussions>`_
sections of our GitHub page.

If your problem has never been reported before, the best way to get help is to
`open a new issue <https://github.com/LaboratoireMecaniqueLille/crappy/issues/new/choose>`_
on the GitHub page. Alternatively, you can also `open a new discussion
<https://github.com/LaboratoireMecaniqueLille/crappy/discussions/new/choose>`_
to chat in a more informal way with the community. When reporting a bug, make
sure to always **indicate which OS you're running, which version of Python**
**you're using, and include both your script and the error Traceback you get**.
You can also attach the log file, located at ``/tmp/crappy/logs.txt`` on Linux
and macOS, or at ``C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Temp\crappy\logs.txt`` on
Windows.
