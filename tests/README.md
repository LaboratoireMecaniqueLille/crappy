Tests
=====

This folder contains the test suite that allows checking if CRAPPY runs as 
expected. The unit tests check the methods and functions individually, and the
integration tests check if the module performs well at runtime. All tests are
performed using the ``unittest`` module.

**WARNING** :
The test suite is currently work in progress, and should be fully functional 
and used in the coming releases.
