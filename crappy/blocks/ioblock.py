    Args:
      name: The name of the :ref:`In / Out` class to instantiate.
      labels: A :obj:`list` containing the output labels for InOuts that
        acquire data. They correspond to the values returned by the InOut's
        :meth:`get_data` method, so there should be as many labels as values
        returned, and given in the appropriate order. The first label must
        always be the timestamp, preferably called ``'t(s)'``. This argument
        can be omitted if :meth:`get_data` returns a :obj:`dict` instead of a
        :obj:`list`. Ignored if the block has no output link.
      cmd_labels: A :obj:`list` of the labels considered as inputs for this
        block, for InOuts that set commands. The values received from these
        labels will be passed to the InOut's :meth:`set_cmd` method, in the
        same order as the labels are given. Usually, time is not part of the
        cmd_labels. Ignored if the block has no input link.
      trigger_label: If given, the block will only read data whenever a value
        (can be any value) is received on this label. Ignored if the block has
        no output link. A trigger label can also be a cmd label.
      streamer: If :obj:`False`, the :meth:`get_data` method of the InOut
        object is called for acquiring data, else it's the :meth:`get_stream`
        method.
      initial_cmd: An initial command for the InOut, set during
        :meth:`prepare`. If given, there must be as many values as in
        cmd_labels.
      exit_cmd: A final command for the InOut, set during :obj:`finish`. If
        given, there must be as many values as in cmd_labels.
      make_zero_delay: If set, will acquire data before the beginning of the
        test and use it to offset all the labels to zero. The data will be
        acquired during the given number of seconds. Ignored if the block has
        no output links.
      spam: If :obj:`False`, the block will call :meth:`set_cmd` on the
        InOut object only if the current command is different from the
        previous.
      freq: The block will try to loop as this frequency, or as fast as
        possible if no value is given.
      verbose: If :obj:`True`, prints the looping frequency of the block.
      **kwargs: The arguments to be passed to the :ref:`In / Out` class.
