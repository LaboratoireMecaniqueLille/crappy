  not in position.

  It also outputs the difference between the center of the image and the middle

      gain: The gain for driving the actuator in speed. The speed command is
        simply the difference in pixels between the center of the image and the
        center of the spots, multiplied by this gain.
      direction: Indicates which axis to consider for driving the actuator, and
        whether the action should be inverted. The first character is the axis
        (`X` or `Y`) and second character is the inversion (`+` or `-`). The
        inversion depends on whether a positive speed will make bring the spots
        closer or farther, you have to try !
      pixel_range: The size of the image (in pixels) along the chosen axis.
      max_speed: The absolute maximum speed value that can be sent to the
        actuator.
      freq: The block will try to loop at this frequency.
      verbose: If :obj:`True`, prints the looping frequency of the block.
