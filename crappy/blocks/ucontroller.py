        is not :obj:`None`, then the``init_output`` argument should be given as
        well. No more than 9 labels should be given.
      cmd_labels (:obj:`list`, optional): The list of the command labels that
        will be sent to the device upon reception from an upstream block. The
        variables in the MicroPython script should have these exact names. No
        more than 9 cmd_labels should be given.
      init_output (:obj:`dict`, optional): If the ``labels`` argument is not
        :obj:`None`, the values to output to downstream blocks for each label
        as long as no value has been received from the device. An initial
        output value must be given for each label.
      post_process (:obj:`dict`, optional): Optionally allows applying a
        function to the data of a label before transmitting it to downstream
        blocks. It is possible to give functions for only part of the labels.
      t_device (:obj:`bool`, optional): It :obj:`True`, the timestamp returned
        under the label `'t(s)'` is the one of the device, not the one of
        Crappy. It may reduce the maximum achievable sample rate, as more bytes
        have to be transmitted, but it is also far more precise.
      port (:obj:`str`, optional): The serial port to open for communicating
        with the device. In Windows, they are usually called `COMx`, whereas in
        Linux and Mac they're called `/dev/ttyxxxx`.
      baudrate (:obj:`int`, optional): The baudrate for serial communication.
        It depends on the capabilities of the device.
      verbose (:obj:`bool`, optional): If :obj:`True`, prints debugging
        information.
      freq (:obj:`float`, optional): The looping frequency of the block.
