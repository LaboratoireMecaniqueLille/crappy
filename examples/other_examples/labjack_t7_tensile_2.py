"""
Detailed example showing a videoextensometry-driven tensile test.

This example uses a Labjack T7 board to send the position command to a tensile
machine. This was tested on an Instron 5882, but any tensile machine taking an
external command can be used. A camera is used to measure the strain of the
sample and save the images. Different levels of strain are applied and the
sample is relaxed between each step.

Required hardware:
  - Tensile machine able to take an external command
  - DAQ board (here a Labjack T7)
  - A Camera

  # Load until the strain is reached, unload until F(N)<1
  paths = []
  for strain in [.25, .5, .75, 1., 1.5, 2]:

  # Just like the previous example, we create the generator with our new path
  gen = crappy.blocks.Generator(paths, cmd_label='cmd')

  # The DAQ board, this section is identical
  force = {'name': 'AIN0', 'gain': FORCE_GAIN}

                              cmd_labels=['cmd'])

  crappy.link(gen, daq)
  # And we ALSO need to link the daq to the generator because it takes
  # decisions based on the values of the force
  # crappy.link(a,b) and crappy.link(b,a) are NOT equivalent because links are
  # unidirectional ! Data only flows from the first block to the second
  crappy.link(daq, gen)
  # It is perfectly fine to make "loops" by linking in both directions
  # like this

  # Recorder for the data from the machine
  rec_daq = crappy.blocks.Recorder('results_daq.csv')
  crappy.link(daq, rec_daq)

  # Now let's add our now sensor: videoextensometry
  # We can specify arguments specific to the camera in the block
  # save_folder asks the block to save the images
  # It can be useful for further processing after the test
  ve = crappy.blocks.VideoExtenso('Webcam', save_folder='img/')
  # When the program will start, this will open a windows to preview the
  # video from the camera, adjust the settings and select the markers.

  # Now we must link this block to the generator
  crappy.link(ve, gen)
  # and to a recorder
  rec_ve = crappy.blocks.Recorder('results_ve.csv')
  crappy.link(ve, rec_ve)
  # Quick remark on recorders: we used two separate blocks for daq and ve.
  # This is because they can only take a SINGLE INPUT. Because the input blocks
  # may run at different frequencies, it is not possible to build a csv file
  # simply from two or more separate sources.
  # We could interpolate them in the same
  # timebase (see block Multiplexer) but this means loosing the raw data. It is
  # much better to perform this interpolation in post-processing if necessary

  # Our force against time plot
  graph_f = crappy.blocks.Grapher(('t(s)', 'F(N)'))
  # Adding a Mean modifier to average the points
  # It lowers the frequency and makes the graph smoother
  crappy.link(daq, graph_f, modifier=crappy.modifier.Mean(10))

  # Let's add a second graph to plot strain against time
  graph_s = crappy.blocks.Grapher(('t(s)', 'Exx(%)'))
  crappy.link(ve, graph_s)

  # We can now start the program
  crappy.start()
