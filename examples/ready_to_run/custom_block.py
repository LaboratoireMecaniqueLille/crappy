"""
Demonstration of how to create a custom Block in Crappy.

This block is intended to be used as a template, it doesn't actually act on
any device nor do anything exceptional.

No hardware required.

# This class can be used as a starting point to create a new block. All methods
# except loop are optional.
# To add it to crappy, make the imports relative (refer to any other block),
# move the class to a file in crappy/blocks and add the corresponding line
# in crappy/blocks/__init__.py


# crappy.Block is a shortcut for crappy.blocks.Block
