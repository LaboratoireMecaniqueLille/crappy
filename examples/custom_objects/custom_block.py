"""
This example demonstrates the instantiation of a custom Block object in Crappy.
The example presented here shows most of the attributes and methods to use when
building a Block. It does not require any hardware nor specific Python module
to run.

In Crappy, users can define their own Block object and use them in their
scripts. This way, users can finely customize their test scripts without having
to integrate new Blocks in the distributed version of Crappy.

Here, a new Block object is instantiated that simply displays in the console
the data it receives from a Generator Block. It also sends data for a Dashboard
Block to display. Several arguments of the custom Block can be tuned, including
one allowing to choose which method to use for receiving data. The goal here is
to show the methods and attributes to use for creating a custom Block object.

After starting this script, watch in the console how the data from the
Generator is received by the CustomBlock. In the Dashboard window you can also
see how the data is successfully sent by the CustomBlock. You can adjust the
various settings of the Block, especially the method to use for receiving data.
Also play with the looping frequency of the custom and Generator Blocks to see
what happens when several chunks are waiting in the Links. This demo ends after
t_limit seconds. You can also hit CTRL+C to stop it earlier, but it is not a
clean way to stop Crappy.
