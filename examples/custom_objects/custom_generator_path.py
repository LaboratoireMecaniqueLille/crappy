"""
This example demonstrates the instantiation of a custom Generator Path object
in Crappy. The example presented here shows most of the features of a Path
object. It does not require any hardware to run, but necessitates the
matplotlib Python module to be installed.

In Crappy, users can define their own Path objects and use them along with
the Generator Block. This way, users can finely customize their test scripts
without having to integrate new Paths in the distributed version of Crappy.

Here, a new Path object is instantiated that generates sine waves elevated to
a given power. This behavior could also be achieved using the Sine Path and a
Modifier, but the custom Path is defined here for the sake of the demo. The
Path is controlled by a Generator Block, that outputs its data to a Grapher
Block for display. The goal here is to show the methods to use for creating a
custom Path object.

After starting this script, watch how the signal is generated as desired by the
custom Path and displayed in the Grapher. You can adjust the various settings
of the Path in the Generator Block and see how it affects the signal. This demo
ends after 22s. You can also hit CTRL+C to stop it earlier, but it is not a
clean way to stop Crappy.
