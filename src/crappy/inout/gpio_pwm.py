    Args:
      pin_out: The index of GPIO pin to drive in BCM convention, as an
        :obj:`int`.
      duty_cycle: If provided (as a :obj:`float`, in percent), sets a fixed
        duty cycle for the entire test. Only the frequency can then be tuned.
        If not provided, the duty cycle can be set as a command. The duty cycle
        will also be set to `0%` until a first value is received.
      frequency: If provided (as a :obj:`float`, in Hz), sets a fixed PWM
        frequency for the entire test. Only the duty cycle can then be tuned.
        If not provided, the frequency can be set as a command. The frequency
        will also be set to `10kHz` until a first value is received. Note that
        the frequency inputs are clamped between `10Hz` and `1MHz`.

    Note:
      Several values can be passed at once as a command. If both ``duty_cycle``
      and ``frequency`` are provided, all the values are ignored. If only
      ``frequency`` is provided, the first command value sets the duty cycle
      and any other value is ignored. Same goes if only ``duty_cycle`` is
      provided. If none of the two arguments are provided, the first command
      value should set the duty cycle and the second command value should set
      the frequency.

    Note:
      On the Raspberry Pi 4, only the GPIO pins `12`, `13`, `18` and `19`
      support hardware PWM. Trying to get a PWM output from other pins might
      work but may decrease the available frequency range.
