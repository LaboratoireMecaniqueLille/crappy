    Args:
      channels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        all the channels to read, given as :obj:`int`. Only the `AIN` channels
        can be read by this class, so to read the channel `AIN2` the integer
        `2` should be added to the iterable.
      gain: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing for
        each channel the gain to apply to the measured voltage, as a
        :obj:`float`. The returned voltage is calculated as follows :
        :math:`returned\_voltage = gain * measured\_voltage + offset`. If not
        given, no gain is applied to the measured values.
      offset: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing for
        each channel the offset to apply to the measured voltage, as a
        :obj:`float`. The returned voltage is calculated as follows :
        :math:`returned\_voltage = gain * measured\_voltage + offset`. If not
        given, no offset is applied to the measured values.
      make_zero: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        for each channel a :obj:`bool` indicating whether the channel should be
        zeroed or not. If so, data will be acquired on this channel before the
        test starts, and a compensation value will be deduced so that the
        offset of this channel is `0`. **It will only take effect if the**
        ``make_zero_delay`` **argument of the** :class:`~crappy.blocks.IOBlock`
        **controlling the Labjack is set** ! If not given, the channels are by
        default not zeroed.
      resolution: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        for each channel the resolution of the acquisition as an integer. Refer
        to Labjack documentation for more details. The higher this value the
        better the resolution, but the lower the speed. The possible range is
        `1` to `12`, and the default is `12`.

    Note:
      All the :iterables given as arguments for the channels should have the
      same length. If that's not the case, all the given iterables are treated
      as if they had the same length as the shortest given one.
