    Args:
      dac_channels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) of
        :obj:`str` representing the channels to be set. The syntax for each
        string is 'DACi' with i being either `0` or `1`.
      adc_channels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) of
        :obj:`str` representing the channels to read. The syntax for all the
        strings is either:
        ::

          'ADi' (i in range(8))

        or else:
        ::

          'ADi - ADj' (i, j in range(8))

      gain_hardware: The gain to be used by the programmable gain amplifier.
        Setting a high gain allows to read small voltages with a better
        precision, but it might saturate the sensor for higher voltages. The
        available gain values are:
        ::

          1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64

      v_ref: The voltage reference set by the `VREF` jumper. When reading
        single inputs, ``v_ref`` is the value the ADC compares the signals
        with. In a similar way, the maximum output voltage of the DAC is
        ``v_ref``. `3.3` and `5` are the only possible values for this setting,
        as the FT232H can only provide `3.3V` and `5V`.
      gain: Allows to tune the output values of the ADC according to the
        formula : :math:`output = gain * tension + offset`. The same gain
        applies to all the outputs.
      offset: Allows to tune the output values of the ADC according to the
        formula : :math:`output = gain * tension + offset`. The same offset
        applies to all the outputs.
      sample_rate: The ADC data output rate in SPS. The available values are:
        ::

          2.5, 5, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 60, 100, 500,
          1000, 2000, 3750, 7500, 15000, 30000

      _ft232h_args: This argument is meant for internal use only and should not
        be provided by the user. It contains the information necessary for
        setting up the FT232H.
      rst_pin_ads: The pin for resetting the ADS1256.
      cs_pin_ads: The chip select pin for the ADS1256.
      drdy_pin_ads: The pin for knowing when a conversion result in ready.
      cs_pin_dac: The chip select pin for the DAC8552.

    Warning:
      - ``adc_channels``:
        For reading single inputs the `JMP_AGND` jumper should normally be
        connected, whereas it should be disconnected for reading differential
        inputs. It is however possible to set a different reference than `AGND`
        for single input measurements, in which case the `JMP_AGND` jumper
        should not be connected and the voltage reference should be plugged
        in the `AINCOM` pin.

        The AD/DA offers the possibility to read single inputs or
        differential inputs, but not both at the same time ! This is due to
        the `JMP_AGND` jumper.
        For measuring both input types simultaneously, is it necessary to
        connect `AGND` to one of the channels (for example `AD0`). Then all
        single inputs `'ADi'` should be replaced by `'ADi - AD0'`. They are
        then considered as differential inputs.

        The ADC channels voltages should not be lower than `AGND-0.1V`, and not
        be greater than `AGND+5.1V`. This is independent of `VREF` value.

    Note:
      - ``adc_channels``:
        If multiple channels to read are given, they are read in a sequential
        way. This means that there's a small delay between each acquisition,
        and the timeframe is thus less accurate for the last channels than
        for the first ones. If time precision matters it is preferable to
        read as few channels as possible !

      - ``vref``:
        `VREF` can be set independently of the chosen `VCC` value. The `VCC`
        value has no influence on the ADC behaviour as it is always powered
        up with `5V`. Same goes for the DAC.
