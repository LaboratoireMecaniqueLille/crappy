  Compared with single point acquisition, the streaming mode can achieve much
  higher data rates and has a much greater regularity in the frequency of the
  acquisition. However, fewer options are available and not all types of
  channels can be read in the streamer mode.

  For each channel, the voltage range can be tuned, and a gain and offset can
  be defined. Also, the user can decide whether the channel should be zeroed
  before starting the test or not.

  Important:
    The ``streamer`` argument of the IOBlock controlling this InOut must be set
    to :obj:`True` to enable streaming in this class. Otherwise, only single
    point acquisition can be performed.

      channels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) of the
        channels to interface with on the Labjack. Each object in this iterable
        should be a :obj:`dict` representing a single channel, and whose keys
        provide information on the channel to use. Refer to the note below for
        more information on the possible keys.
      device: The type of Labjack to open. Possible values include :
        ::

          'ANY', 'T7', 'T4', 'DIGIT'

        Only tested with `'T7'` in Crappy.
      connection: The type of connection used for interfacing with the Labjack.
        Possible values include :
        ::

          'ANY', 'TCP', 'USB', 'ETHERNET', 'WIFI'

      identifier: Any extra information allowing to further identify the
        Labjack to open, like a serial number, an IP address, or a device name.
      scan_rate: The acquisition frequency in Hz for all channels. Note that
        the sample rate (`scan_rate * num of chan`) cannot exceed `100000`. If
        it is too high it will be lowered to the highest possible value.
      scan_per_read: The number of points to read at each loop.
      resolution: The resolution of the acquisition as an integer for all
        channels. Refer to Labjack documentation for more details. The higher
        this value the better the resolution, but the lower the speed. The
        possible range is either `1` to `8` or to `12` depending on the model.
        The default is `1`.

    Note:
      - ``channels`` keys:

        - name: The name of the channel to interface with, as written on the
          Labjack's case. Ex: `'AIN0'`. In streamer mode, only the `AIN`
          channels, i.e. the analog inputs, are available.

        - gain: The measured value will be modified in Crappy as follows :
          :math:`returned\_value = gain * measured\_value + offset`.

        - offset: The measured value will be modified in Crappy as follows :
          :math:`returned\_value = gain * measured\_value + offset`

        - make_zero: If :obj:`True`, data will be acquired on this channel
          before the test starts, and a compensation value will be deduced
          so that the offset of this channel is `0`. **It will only take effect
          if the** ``make_zero_delay`` **argument of the**
          :class:`~crappy.blocks.IOBlock` **controlling the Labjack is set** !

        - range: The range of the acquisition in Volts. A range of `x` means
          that values can be read  between `-x` and `x` Volts. The possible
          values are :
          ::

            0.01, 0.1, 1, 10
