    Args:
      channels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) of the
        channels to interface with on the Labjack. Each object in this iterable
        should be a :obj:`dict` representing a single channel, and whose keys
        provide information on the channel to use. Refer to the note below for
        more information on the possible keys.
      device: The type of Labjack to open. Possible values include :
        ::

          'ANY', 'T7', 'T4', 'DIGIT'

        Only tested with `'T7'` in Crappy.
      connection: The type of connection used for interfacing with the Labjack.
        Possible values include :
        ::

          'ANY', 'TCP', 'USB', 'ETHERNET', 'WIFI'

      identifier: Any extra information allowing to further identify the
        Labjack to open, like a serial number, an IP address, or a device name.
      write_at_open: If specific names or registers have to be written when
        opening the channel, they can be given here as an iterable (like a
        :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) of :obj:`tuple`. They will be written in
        the same order as in the given iterable. Refer to the note below for
        the accepted formats.
      no_led: If :obj:`True`, turns off the LED on the Labjack. This led can
        generate noise on the channels `AIN0` and `AIN1`.

    Note:
      - ``channels`` keys:

        - name: The name of the channel to interface with, as written on the
          Labjack's case. Ex: `'AIN0'`. The available settings as well as the
          direction of the channel depend on the given name.

          The name can be:
            - `AINx`: Analog input, linked to an ADC. A gain and offset can be
              provided, and the range and resolution can be adjusted. It is
              always an input. These channels can also be used with
              thermocouples (see below).
            - `(T)DACx`: Analog output, linked to a DAC. A gain and an offset
              can be specified. It is always an output.
            - `(E/F/C/M IOx)`: Digital inputs/outputs. A gain and an offset
              can be specified. It can be either an input or an output, the
              default is output.

        - gain: If the channel is an input, the measured value will be
          modified directly by the Labjack as follows :
          :math:`returned\_value = gain * measured\_value + offset`. If the
          channel is an output, the command value will be modified in Crappy as
          follows before being sent to the Labjack :
          :math:`sent\_value = gain * command + offset`.
        - offset: If the channel is an input, the measured value will be
          modified directly by the Labjack as follows :
          :math:`returned\_value = gain * measured\_value + offset`. If the
          channel is an output, the command value will be modified in Crappy as
          follows before being sent to the Labjack :
          :math:`sent\_value = gain * command + offset`.
        - make_zero: If :obj:`True`, data will be acquired on this channel
          before the test starts, and a compensation value will be deduced
          so that the offset of this channel is `0`. The compensation is
          performed directly by the Labjack. This setting only has effect for
          `AIN` channels defined as inputs. **It will only take effect if the**
          ``make_zero_delay`` **argument of the**
          :class:`~crappy.blocks.IOBlock` **controlling the Labjack is set** !

        - direction: If :obj:`True`, the channel is considered as an output,
          else as an input. Only has effect for `IO` channels, the default is
          output.

        - resolution: The resolution of the acquisition as an integer, refer to
          Labjack documentation for more details. The higher this value the
          better the resolution, but the lower the speed. The possible range is
          either `1` to `8` or to `12` depending on the model. The default is
          `1`. Only has effect for `AIN` channels.

        - range: The range of the acquisition in Volts. A range of `x` means
          that values can be read  between `-x` and `x` Volts. The possible
          values are :
          ::

            0.01, 0.1, 1, 10

          Only has effect for `AIN` channels.

        - limits: A :obj:`tuple` containing the minimum and maximum allowed
          command values to set for this channel. After applying the gain and
          offset to the command, it is then clamped between these two values
          before being sent to the Labjack. Only has effect for output
          channels.

        - thermocouple: The type of thermocouple to read data from. Possible
          values are:
          ::

            'E', 'J', 'K', 'R', 'T', 'S', 'C'

          If specified, it will use the EF to read a temperature directly from
          the thermocouples. Only has effect for `AIN` channels.

        - write_at_open: A :obj:`list` containing commands for writing specific
          names or registers when opening the channel. The commands should be
          given as :obj:`tuple` either in the format
          `(name (str), value (int/float))` or
          `(register (int), type (int), value (float/int))`.

    Warning:
      Do not consider the ``limits`` key as a safety feature. It *should* not
      go beyond/below the given values, but this is not meant to replace
      hardware safety !
