    Args:
      device: The name of the device to open, as a :obj:`str`.
      channels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        the names of the channels to use as inputs, given as :obj:`str`.
        Typical names for inputs are ``'aiX'```, with `X` an integer.
      gain: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing for
        each input channel the gain to apply to the measured voltage, as a
        :obj:`float`. The returned voltage is calculated as follows
        :math:`returned\_voltage = gain * measured\_voltage + offset`. If not
        given, no gain is applied to the measured values.
      offset: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing for
        each input channel the offset to apply to the measured voltage, as a
        :obj:`float`. The returned voltage is calculated as follows
        :math:`returned\_voltage = gain * measured\_voltage + offset`. If not
        given, no offset is applied to the measured values.
      ranges: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing for
        each input channel the range to set for that channel, as a
        :obj:`float`. The possible range values are :
        ::

          0.5, 1., 2.5, 5.

        If not given, all input channels will be set to the range `5`.
      make_zero: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        for each input channel a :obj:`bool` indicating whether the channel
        should be zeroed or not. If so, data will be acquired on this channel
        before the test starts, and a compensation value will be deduced so
        that the offset of this channel is `0`. **It will only take effect if
        the** ``make_zero_delay`` **argument of the**
        :class:`~crappy.blocks.IOBlock` **controlling the DAQ is set** ! If not
        given, the channels are by default not zeroed.
      sample_rate: The frequency of the acquisition, as a :obj:`float`. The
        higher this number, the more noise there is on the signal but the
        higher the acquisition frequency.
      out_channels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`)
        containing the names of the channels to use as outputs, given as
        :obj:`str`. Typical names for outputs are ``'aoX'``, with `X` an
        integer.
      out_gain: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        for each output channel the gain to apply to the command voltage, as a
        :obj:`float`. The set voltage is calculated as follows :
        :math:`set\_voltage = out\_gain * command\_voltage + out\_offset`. If
        not given, no gain is applied to the command values.
      out_offset: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        for each output channel the offset to apply to the command voltage, as
        a :obj:`float`. The set voltage is calculated as follows :
        :math:`set\_voltage = out\_gain * command\_voltage + out\_offset`. If
        not given, no offset is applied to the command values.
      out_ranges: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        for each output channel the range to set for that channel, as a
        :obj:`float`. The possible range values are :
        ::

          0.5, 1., 2.5, 5.

        If not given, all output channels will be set to the range `5`.

    Note:
      All the iterables given as arguments for the input channels should have
      the same length, and same for the output channels. If that's not the
      case, all the given iterables are treated as if they had the same length
      as the shortest given one.
