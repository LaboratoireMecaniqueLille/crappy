  should be offset to `0` at the beginning of the test.

  Communicates over serial. This class was implemented and tested on a USB-DUX

    Args:
      device: The address of the device, as a :obj:`str`.
      sub_device: The id of the subdevice to use for input channels, as an
        :obj:`int`.
      channels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        the indexes of the channels to use as inputs, given as :obj:`int`.
      range_num: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        for each input channel the index of the range to set for that channel,
        as an :obj:`int`. Refer to the documentation of the board to get the
        correspondence between range indexes and Volts. If not given, all input
        channels will be set to the range `0`.
      gain: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing for
        each input channel the gain to apply to the measured voltage, as a
        :obj:`float`. The returned voltage is calculated as follows :
        :math:`returned\_voltage = gain * measured\_voltage + offset`. If not
        given, no gain is applied to the measured values.
      offset: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing for
        each input channel the offset to apply to the measured voltage, as a
        :obj:`float`. The returned voltage is calculated as follows :
        :math:`returned\_voltage = gain * measured\_voltage + offset`. If not
        given, no offset is applied to the measured values.
      make_zero: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        for each input channel a :obj:`bool` indicating whether the channel
        should be zeroed or not. If so, data will be acquired on this channel
        before the test starts, and a compensation value will be deduced so
        that the offset of this channel is `0`. **It will only take effect if
        the** ``make_zero_delay`` **argument of the**
        :class:`~crappy.blocks.IOBlock` **controlling the Comedi is set** ! If
        not given, the channels are by default not zeroed.
      out_sub_device: The id of the subdevice to use for output channels, as an
        :obj:`int`.
      out_channels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`)
        containing the indexes of the channels to use as outputs, given as
        :obj:`int`.
      out_range_num: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`)
        containing for each output channel the index of the range to set for
        that channel, as an :obj:`int`. Refer to the documentation of the board
        to get the correspondence between range indexes and Volts. If not
        given, all output channels will be set to the range `0`.
      out_gain: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        for each output channel the gain to apply to the command voltage, as a
        :obj:`float`. The set voltage is calculated as follows :
        .. math::

          set_voltage = out_gain * command_voltage + out_offset

        If not given, no gain is applied to the command values.
      out_offset: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        for each output channel the offset to apply to the command voltage, as
        a :obj:`float`. The set voltage is calculated as follows :
        .. math::

          set_voltage = out_gain * command_voltage + out_offset

        If not given, no offset is applied to the command values.

    Note:
      All the iterables given as arguments for the input channels should have
      the same length, and same for the output channels. If that's not the
      case, all the given iterables are treated as if they had the same length
      as the shortest given one.
