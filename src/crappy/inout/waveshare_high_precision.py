  """This InOut allows acquiring data from Waveshare's High Precision HAT.

  This board features an ADS1263 32-bits ADC, which is what this InOut actually
  drives. The main specificities compared with driving just an ADS1263 are that
  the reference voltage is the board's 5V supply, and that the differential
  acquisition is improved when using pairs of channels (0 & 1, 2 & 3, etc.).

  The sample rate, hardware gain and digital filter can be adjusted. It is also
  possible to acquire data sequentially from several channels.

  The Waveshare HAT is originally meant to be used with a Raspberry Pi, but it
  can be used with any device supporting SPI as long as the wiring is correct
  and the 3.3 and 5V power are supplied.

    Args:
      spi_port: The SPI port for communicating with the Waveshare HAT.
      gain_hardware: A programmable gain for the signal. Should be one of :
        ::

          1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32

        Allows increasing the resolution of the ADC, but also divides the full
        scale range and greatly reduces the noise performance when set greater
        than 8. This value applies to all the channels.
      sample_rate: The number of samples per second to acquire. Should be one
        of:
        ::

          2.5, 5, 10, 16?6, 20, 50, 60, 100, 400, 1200, 2400, 4800, 7200,
          14400, 19200, 38400

        The actual achieved sample rate might be lower depending on the
        capability of the PC and the load on the processor. Note that the
        greater the sample rate, the greater the noise. For multiple channels,
        the achieved sample rate is roughly the target sample rate divided by
        the number of channels.
      channels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        strings representing the channels to acquire. Each channel must follow
        one of the two syntax :
        ::

          'INi', i in range(10)

        or else
        ::

          'INi-INj', i, j in range(10)

        With the first syntax, the output is the voltage difference between the
        acquired channel and the ground of the power supply. With the second
        syntax, the output value is simply the difference between the voltages
        of the channels `i` and `j`. It is preferable to use the channels in
        pair (0 & 1, 2 & 3, etc.) for differential acquisition. The data from
        the different channels is acquired sequentially, not all at once.
      digital_filter: The Waveshare Hat features a digital filter that can
        accept different settings. Refer to the documentation of the ADS1263
        for more detail.
      gain: Allows to tune the output values of the ADC according to the
        formula : :math:`output = gain * tension + offset`. The same gain
        applies to all the channels.
      offset: Allows to tune the output values of the ADC according to the
        formula : :math:`output = gain * tension + offset`. The same offset
        applies to all the channels.

    Important:
      When the ``gain_hardware`` is greater than 1, the PGA cannot amplify
      above 4.7V or under 0.3V. For example a 2.8V signal read with a gain of 2
      would be read as 4.7V after the PGA, not 4.8V ! Beware !
