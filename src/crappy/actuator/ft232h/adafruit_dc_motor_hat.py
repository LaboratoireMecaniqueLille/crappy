  """Class for driving Adafruit's DC motor HAT via an FT232H USB to I2C
  converter.

  It can drive up to four DC motors in speed only. The acquisition of the speed
  has not been implemented so far. It implements the same functionality as the
  :class:`~crappy.actuator.DCMotorHat`, but communicates with the hat over USB
  via an FT232H device.

  Important:
    As this Actuator can drive up to 4 motors simultaneously, it takes a
    :obj:`tuple` as a command, see :meth:`set_speed`. Regular Actuators receive
    their commands as :obj:`float`. A :class:`~crappy.modifier.Modifier` can be
    used for converting a :obj:`float` command from a
    :class:`~crappy.blocks.Generator` to a :obj:`tuple`.

  Note:
    The DC Motor Hat can also drive stepper motors, but this feature isn't
    included here."""
