  It can drive up to four DC motors in speed only. The acquisition of the speed
  has not been implemented so far. It can either rely on Adafruit's Blinka
  library, or on :mod:`smbus2` if used from a Raspberry Pi.

  Important:
    As this Actuator can drive up to 4 motors simultaneously, it takes a
    :obj:`tuple` as a command, see :meth:`set_speed`. Regular Actuators receive
    their commands as :obj:`float`. A :class:`~crappy.modifier.Modifier` can be
    used for converting a :obj:`float` command from a
    :class:`~crappy.blocks.Generator` to a :obj:`tuple`.

  Note:
    The DC Motor Hat can also drive stepper motors, but this feature isn't
    included here.
