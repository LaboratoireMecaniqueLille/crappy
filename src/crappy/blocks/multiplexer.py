class Multiplexer(Block):
  """This Block takes data from upstream Blocks as input and interpolates it to
  output all the labels in a common time basis.

  It can take any number of inputs, provided that they all share a common time
  label. It is also possible to choose which labels are considered for
  multiplexing and which are dropped. The interpolation is performed using the
  :obj:`numpy.interp` method.

  This Block is useful for synchronizing data acquired from different sensors,
  e.g. to plot a real-time stress-strain curve with position data coming from a
  :class:`~crappy.blocks.Machine` Block and force data coming from a
  :class:`~crappy.blocks.IOBlock` Block. Multiplexing is however quite
  resource-consuming, so it is preferable to perform interpolation when
  post-processing if real-time is not needed.

  Note:
    This Block doesn't truly output data in real-time as it needs to wait for
    data from all the upstream Blocks before performing the interpolation. It
    should only be used with care as an input to a decision-making Block. This
    is especially true when the upstream Blocks have very different sampling
    rates.
