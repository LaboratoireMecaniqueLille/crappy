  It communicates with an MQTT broker, from which it can receive data by

  This Block can also manage the execution of a Mosquitto broker, so that the
  broker doesn't need to be manually started before running the Crappy script.

  This Block is intended for communication with remote devices, that may run
  Crappy scripts or other scripts handling data with the correct syntax.
  Potential uses include acquisition from battery-powered devices (e.g.
  microcontrollers) acquiring data in enclosed areas or rotating parts, data
  transfer between machines to delegate processing, communication with other
  programs on a same machine, etc.

    """Checks the validity of the arguments and sets the instance attributes.

    Args:
      broker: If :obj:`True`, starts the Mosquitto broker during the prepare
        loop and stops it during the finish loop. If Mosquitto is not installed
        a :exc:`FileNotFoundError` is raised.
      address: The network address on which the MQTT broker is running, as a
        :obj:`str`.
      port: A network port on which the MQTT broker is listening, as an 
        :obj:`int`.
      init_output: A :obj:`dict` containing for each label in ``topics`` the 
        first value to be sent in the output Links. Should be given in case the 
        data comes from several sources and data for all labels may not be 
        available during the first loops. 
      topics: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        :obj:`str` and/or iterables of :obj:`str`. Each string corresponds to
        the name of a label in Crappy. Each element in the iterable (string or
        iterable of strings) is considered to be the name of an MQTT topic, to
        which the client subscribes. After a message has been received on that
        topic, the Block returns for each label in the topic (just the given
        string or each string in the iterable) the corresponding data from the
        message. It also returns the current timestamp in the label `'t(s)'`.
      cmd_labels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        :obj:`str` and/or iterables of :obj:`str`. Each string corresponds to
        the name of a label in Crappy. Each element in the iterable (string or
        iterable of strings) is considered to be the name of an MQTT topic, in
        which the client publishes. Grouping labels in a same topic (i.e.
        strings in a same iterable) allows to keep the synchronization between
        signals coming from a same Block, as they will be published together in
        a same message. This is mostly useful for sending a signal along with
        its timeframe.
      labels_to_send: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`)
        containing :obj:`str` and/or iterables of :obj:`str`. Allows to rename
        the labels before publishing data. The structure of ``labels_to_send``
        should be the exact same as ``cmd_labels``, with each label in
        ``labels_to_send`` replacing the corresponding one in ``cmd_labels``.
        This is especially useful for transferring several signals along with
        their timestamps, as the label ``'t(s)'`` should not appear more than
        once in the topics.
      display_freq: If :obj:`True`, displays the looping frequency of the
        Block.
      freq: The target looping frequency for the Block. If :obj:`None`, loops
        as fast as possible.
      spam: If :obj:`True`, sends the last received values at each loop even if
        no new values were received from the broker.
      debug: If :obj:`True`, displays all the log messages including the
        :obj:`~logging.DEBUG` ones. If :obj:`False`, only displays the log
        messages with :obj:`~logging.INFO` level or higher. If :obj:`None`,
        disables logging for this Block.

    Note:
      - ``broker``:
        In order for the Block to run, an MQTT broker must be running at the
        specified address on the specified port. If not, an
        :exc:`ConnectionRefusedError` is raised. The broker can be started and
        stopped manually by the user independently of the execution of Crappy.
        It also doesn't need to be Mosquitto, any other MQTT broker can be
        used.

      - ``topics``:
        The presence of the same label in multiple topics will most likely lead
        to a data loss.

      - ``cmd_labels``:
        It is not possible to group signals coming from different Blocks in a
        same topic.

      - ``labels_to_send``:
        Differences in the structure of ``labels_to_send`` and ``cmd_labels``
        will not always raise an error, but may lead to a data loss.

      - **Single-value iterables**:
        Single-value iterables can be shortened as strings.
