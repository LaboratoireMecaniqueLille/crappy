    Args:
      labels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing the
        labels to get from the device (as :obj:`str`). Only these labels should
        be given as argument to the :meth:`send_to_pc` method in the
        MicroPython script. If this argument is not :obj:`None`, then the
        ``init_output`` argument should be given as well. No more than 9 labels
        should be given. If there's only one label to acquire, it can be given
        directly as a :obj:`str` and not in an iterable.
      cmd_labels: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        the command labels that will be sent to the device upon reception from
        an upstream Block. The variables in the MicroPython script should have
        these exact names. Not more than 9 cmd_labels should be given. If
        there's only one command label, it can be given directly as a
        :obj:`str` and not in an iterable.
      init_output: If the ``labels`` argument is not :obj:`None`, the values to 
        output to downstream Blocks for each label as long as no value has been 
        received from the device. An initial output value must be given for 
        each label.
      post_process: Optionally allows applying a function to the data of a 
        label before transmitting it to downstream Blocks. It is possible to 
        give functions for only part of the labels.
      t_device: It :obj:`True`, the timestamp returned under the label `'t(s)'` 
        is the one of the device, not the one of Crappy. It may reduce the 
        maximum achievable sample rate, as more bytes have to be transmitted, 
        but it is also far more precise.
      port: The serial port to open for communicating with the device. In 
        Windows, they are usually called `COMx`, whereas in Linux and Mac 
        they're called `/dev/ttyxxxx`.
      baudrate: The baudrate for serial communication. It depends on the 
        capabilities of the device.
      display_freq: If :obj:`True`, displays the looping frequency of the
        Block.
      freq: The target looping frequency for the Block. If :obj:`None`, loops 
        as fast as possible.
      debug: If :obj:`True`, displays all the log messages including the
        :obj:`~logging.DEBUG` ones. If :obj:`False`, only displays the log
        messages with :obj:`~logging.INFO` level or higher. If :obj:`None`,
        disables logging for this Block.
