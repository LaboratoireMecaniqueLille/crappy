class Camera(Block):
  """This Block can drive a :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object. It can 
  acquire images, display them and record them. It can only drive one Camera at
  once.
  
  It takes no input :class:`~crappy.links.Link` in a majority of situations,
  and never has output Links. Most of the time, this Block is used for 
  recording to the desired location the images it acquires. Optionally, the 
  images can also be displayed in a dedicated window. Both of these features 
  are however optional, and it is possible to acquire images and not do 
  anything with them. Several options are available for tuning the record and 
  the display.
  
  Before a test starts, this Block can also display a 
  :class:`~crappy.tool.camera_config.CameraConfig` window in which the user can
  visualize the acquired images, and interactively tune all the 
  :class:`~crappy.camera.meta_camera.camera_setting.CameraSetting` available
  for the instantiated :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera`. 
  
  Internally, this Block is only in charge of the image acquisition, and the 
  other tasks are parallelized and delegated to 
  :class:`~crappy.blocks.camera_processes.CameraProcess` objects. The display 
  is handled by the :class:`~crappy.blocks.camera_processes.Displayer`, and
  the recording by the :class:`~crappy.blocks.camera_processes.ImageSaver`.
  This Block manages the instantiation, the synchronisation and the
  termination of all the CameraProcess it controls.

    """Sets the arguments and initializes the parent class.
    
    Args:
      camera: The name of the :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object to use for
        acquiring the images. Arguments can be passed to this Camera as 
        ``kwargs`` of this Block. This argument is ignored if the 
        ``image_generator`` argument is provided.
      transform: A callable taking an image as an argument, and returning a
        transformed image as an output. Allows applying a post-processing
        operation to the acquired images. This is done right after the
        acquisition, so the original image is permanently lost and only the
        transformed image is displayed and/or saved and/or further processed.
        The transform operation is not parallelized, so it might negatively
        affect the acquisition framerate if it is too heavy.
      config: If :obj:`True`, a 
        :class:`~crappy.tool.camera_config.CameraConfig` window is displayed
        before the test starts. There, the user can interactively adjust the 
        different 
        :class:`~crappy.camera.meta_camera.camera_setting.CameraSetting` 
        available for the selected :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera`, and 
        visualize the acquired images. The test starts when closing the 
        configuration window. If not enabled, the ``img_dtype`` and 
        ``img_shape`` arguments must be provided.
      display_images: If :obj:`True`, displays the acquired images in a
        dedicated window, using the backend given in ``displayer_backend`` and
        at the frequency specified in ``displayer_framerate``. This option
        should be considered as a debug or basic follow-up feature, it is not
        intended to be very fast nor to display high-quality images. The
        maximum resolution of the displayed images in `640x480`, the images
        might be downscaled to fit in this format.
      displayer_backend: The backend to use for displaying the images. Can be
        either ``'cv2'`` or ``'mpl'``, to use respectively :mod:`cv2` (OpenCV)
        or :mod:`matplotlib`. ``'cv2'`` usually allows achieving a higher
        display frequency. Ignored if ``display_images`` is :obj:`False`. If
        not given and ``display_images`` is :obj:`True`, ``'cv2'`` is tried
        first and ``'mpl'`` second, and the first available one is used.
      displayer_framerate: The maximum update frequency of the image displayer, 
        as an :obj:`int`. This value usually lies between 5 and 30Hz, the 
        default is 5. The achieved update frequency might be lower than
        requested. Ignored if ``display_images`` is :obj:`False`.
      software_trig_label: The name of a label used as a software trigger for 
        the :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera`. If given, images will only be 
        acquired when receiving data over this label. The received value does
        not matter. This software trigger is not meant to be very precise, it
        is recommended not to rely on it for a trigger frequency greater than
        10Hz, in which case a hardware trigger should be preferred if available
        on the camera.
      display_freq: If :obj:`True`, displays the looping frequency of the
        Block.
      debug: If :obj:`True`, displays all the log messages including the
        :obj:`~logging.DEBUG` ones. If :obj:`False`, only displays the log
        messages with :obj:`~logging.INFO` level or higher. If :obj:`None`,
        disables logging for this Block.
      freq: The target looping frequency for the Block. If :obj:`None`, loops
        as fast as possible.
      save_images: If :obj:`True`, the acquired images are saved to the folder
        specified in ``save_folder``, in the format specified in 
        ``img_extension``, using the backend specified in ``save_backend``, and
        at the frequency specified in ``save_period``. Each image is saved with
        the name : ``<frame_nr>_<timestamp>.<extension>``, and can thus easily
        be identified. Along with the images, a ``metadata.csv`` file records 
        the metadata of all the saved images. This metadata is either the one 
        returned by the :meth:`~crappy.camera.Camera.get_image` method of the
        :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object, or the default one generated in
        the :meth:`loop` method of this Block. Depending on the framerate of
        the camera and the performance of the computer, it is not guaranteed 
        that all the acquired images will be recorded.
      img_extension: The file extension for the recorded images, as a
        :obj:`str` and without the dot. Common file extensions include `tiff`,
        `png`, `jpg`, etc. Depending on the used ``save_backend``, some 
        extensions might not be available. It is currently not possible to
        customize the save parameters further than choosing the file extension.
        Ignored if ``save_images`` is :obj:`False`.
      save_folder: Path to the folder where to save the images, either as a 
        :obj:`str` or as a :obj:`pathlib.Path`. Can be an absolute or a 
        relative path, pointing to a folder. If the folder does not exist, it 
        will be created (if the user has permission). If the given folder 
        already contains a ``metadata.csv`` file (and thus likely images from
        Crappy), images are saved to another folder with the same name except
        a suffix is appended. Ignored if ``save_images`` is :obj:`False`. If
        not provided and ``save_images`` is :obj:`True`, the images are saved
        to the folder ``Crappy_images``, created next to the running script.
      save_period: Must be given as an :obj:`int`. Only one out of that number 
        images at most will be saved. Allows to have a known periodicity in 
        case the framerate is too high to record all the images. Or simply to 
        reduce the number of recorded images if saving them all is not needed.
        Ignored if ``save_images`` is :obj:`False`.
      save_backend: If ``save_images`` is :obj:`True`, the backend to use for 
        recording the images. It should be one of:
        ::

          'sitk', 'cv2', 'pil', 'npy'
        
        They correspond to the modules :mod:`SimpleITK`, :mod:`cv2` (OpenCV),
        :mod:`PIL` (Pillow Fork), and :mod:`numpy`. Note that the ``'npy'``
        backend saves the images as raw :obj:`numpy.array`, and thus ignores
        the ``img_extension`` argument. Depending on the machine, some backends
        may be faster or slower. For using each backend, the corresponding 
        Python must of course be installed. If not provided and ``save_images``
        is :obj:`True`, the backends are tried in the same order as given above
        and the first available one is used. ``'npy'`` is always available.
      image_generator: A callable taking two :obj:`float` as arguments and
        returning an image as a :obj:`numpy.array`. **This argument is intended
        for use in the examples of Crappy, to apply an artificial strain on a
        base image. Most users should ignore it.** When given, the ``camera``
        argument is ignored and the images are acquired from the generator. To
        apply a strain on the image, strain values (in `%`) should be sent to 
        the Camera Block over the labels ``'Exx(%)'`` and ``'Eyy(%)'``.
      img_shape: The shape of the images returned by the 
        :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object as a :obj:`tuple` of :obj:`int`.
        It should correspond to the value returned by :obj:`numpy.shape`. 
        **This argument is mandatory in case** ``config`` **is** :obj:`False`.
        It is otherwise ignored.
      img_dtype: The `dtype` of the images returned by the
        :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object, as a :obj:`str`. It should
        correspond to a valid data type in :mod:`numpy`, e.g. ``'uint8'``.
        **This argument is mandatory in case** ``config`` **is** :obj:`False`.
        It is otherwise ignored.
      **kwargs: Any additional argument will be passed to the 
        :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object, and used as a kwarg to its
        :meth:`~crappy.camera.Camera.open` method.
