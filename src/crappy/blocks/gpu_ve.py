  """This Block can perform GPU-accelerated video-extensometry on images
  acquired by a :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object, by tracking patches and
  computing the strain based on their displacement.

  It takes no input :class:`~crappy.links.Link` in a majority of situations,
  and outputs the results of the video-extensometry. It is a subclass of the
  :class:`~crappy.blocks.Camera` Block, and inherits of all its features. That
  includes the possibility to record and to display images in real-time,
  simultaneously to the image acquisition and processing. Refer to the
  documentation of the Camera Block for more information on these features.

  This Block is quite similar to the :class:`~crappy.blocks.DICVE` Block,
  except this latter is not GPU-accelerated and uses OpenCV's DISFlow. The
  :class:`~crappy.blocks.GPUCorrel` Block also relies on GPU-accelerated image
  correlation for estimating the strain and the displacement on acquired
  images, but it performs correlation on the entire image and is designed to
  have a much greater accuracy. The :class:`~crappy.blocks.VideoExtenso` Block
  also performs video-extensometry, but it does so by tracking spots instead
  of textured patches, and it is not GPU-accelerated.

    """Sets the arguments and initializes the parent class.

    Args:
      camera: The name of the :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object to use for
        acquiring the images. Arguments can be passed to this Camera as
        ``kwargs`` of this Block. This argument is ignored if the
        ``image_generator`` argument is provided.
      patches: The coordinates of the several patches to track, as an iterable
        (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing one or several
        :obj:`tuple` of exactly :obj:`int` values. These integers correspond to
        the `y` position of the top-left corner of the patch, the `x` position
        of the top-left corner of the patch, the height of the patch, and the
        width of the patch. Up to 4 patches can be given and tracked.
      img_shape: The shape of the images returned by the
        :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object as a :obj:`tuple` of :obj:`int`.
        It should correspond to the value returned by :obj:`numpy.shape`.
      img_dtype: The `dtype` of the images returned by the
        :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object, as a :obj:`str`. It should
        correspond to a valid data type in :mod:`numpy`, e.g. ``'uint8'``.
      transform: A callable taking an image as an argument, and returning a
        transformed image as an output. Allows applying a post-processing
        operation to the acquired images. This is done right after the
        acquisition, so the original image is permanently lost and only the
        transformed image is displayed and/or saved and/or further processed.
        The transform operation is not parallelized, so it might negatively
        affect the acquisition framerate if it is too heavy.
      display_images: If :obj:`True`, displays the acquired images in a
        dedicated window, using the backend given in ``displayer_backend`` and
        at the frequency specified in ``displayer_framerate``. This option
        should be considered as a debug or basic follow-up feature, it is not
        intended to be very fast nor to display high-quality images. The
        maximum resolution of the displayed images in `640x480`, the images
        might be downscaled to fit in this format. In addition to the acquired
        frames, the tracked patches are also displayed on the image as an
        overlay.
      displayer_backend: The backend to use for displaying the images. Can be
        either ``'cv2'`` or ``'mpl'``, to use respectively :mod:`cv2` (OpenCV)
        or :mod:`matplotlib`. ``'cv2'`` usually allows achieving a higher
        display frequency. Ignored if ``display_images`` is :obj:`False`. If
        not given and ``display_images`` is :obj:`True`, ``'cv2'`` is tried
        first and ``'mpl'`` second, and the first available one is used.
      displayer_framerate: The maximum update frequency of the image displayer,
        as an :obj:`int`. This value usually lies between 5 and 30Hz, the
        default is 5. The achieved update frequency might be lower than
        requested. Ignored if ``display_images`` is :obj:`False`.
      software_trig_label: The name of a label used as a software trigger for
        the :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera`. If given, images will only be
        acquired when receiving data over this label. The received value does
        not matter. This software trigger is not meant to be very precise, it
        is recommended not to rely on it for a trigger frequency greater than
        10Hz, in which case a hardware trigger should be preferred if available
        on the camera.
      verbose: The verbose level as an integer, between `0` and `3`. At level
        `0` no information is displayed, and at level `3` so much information
        is displayed that is slows the code down. This argument allows to
        adjust the precision of the log messages, while the ``debug`` argument
        is for enabling or disabling logging.
      freq: The target looping frequency for the Block. If :obj:`None`, loops
        as fast as possible.
      debug: If :obj:`True`, displays all the log messages including the
        :obj:`~logging.DEBUG` ones. If :obj:`False`, only displays the log
        messages with :obj:`~logging.INFO` level or higher. If :obj:`None`,
        disables logging for this Block.
      save_images: If :obj:`True`, the acquired images are saved to the folder
        specified in ``save_folder``, in the format specified in
        ``img_extension``, using the backend specified in ``save_backend``, and
        at the frequency specified in ``save_period``. Each image is saved with
        the name : ``<frame_nr>_<timestamp>.<extension>``, and can thus easily
        be identified. Along with the images, a ``metadata.csv`` file records
        the metadata of all the saved images. This metadata is either the one
        returned by the :meth:`~crappy.camera.Camera.get_image` method of the
        :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object, or the default one generated in
        the :meth:`~crappy.blocks.Camera.loop` method of the
        :class:`~crappy.blocks.Camera` Block. Depending on the framerate of the
        camera and the performance of the computer, it is not guaranteed that
        all the acquired images will be recorded.
      img_extension: The file extension for the recorded images, as a
        :obj:`str` and without the dot. Common file extensions include `tiff`,
        `png`, `jpg`, etc. Depending on the used ``save_backend``, some
        extensions might not be available. It is currently not possible to
        customize the save parameters further than choosing the file extension.
        Ignored if ``save_images`` is :obj:`False`.
      save_folder: Path to the folder where to save the images, either as a
        :obj:`str` or as a :obj:`pathlib.Path`. Can be an absolute or a
        relative path, pointing to a folder. If the folder does not exist, it
        will be created (if the user has permission). If the given folder
        already contains a ``metadata.csv`` file (and thus likely images from
        Crappy), images are saved to another folder with the same name except
        a suffix is appended. Ignored if ``save_images`` is :obj:`False`. If
        not provided and ``save_images`` is :obj:`True`, the images are saved
        to the folder ``Crappy_images``, created next to the running script.
      save_period: Must be given as an :obj:`int`. Only one out of that number
        images at most will be saved. Allows to have a known periodicity in
        case the framerate is too high to record all the images. Or simply to
        reduce the number of recorded images if saving them all is not needed.
        Ignored if ``save_images`` is :obj:`False`.
      save_backend: If ``save_images`` is :obj:`True`, the backend to use for
        recording the images. It should be one of:
        ::

          'sitk', 'cv2', 'pil', 'npy'

        They correspond to the modules :mod:`SimpleITK`, :mod:`cv2` (OpenCV),
        :mod:`PIL` (Pillow Fork), and :mod:`numpy`. Note that the ``'npy'``
        backend saves the images as raw :obj:`numpy.array`, and thus ignores
        the ``img_extension`` argument. Depending on the machine, some backends
        may be faster or slower. For using each backend, the corresponding
        Python must of course be installed. If not provided and ``save_images``
        is :obj:`True`, the backends are tried in the same order as given above
        and the first available one is used. ``'npy'`` is always available.
      image_generator: A callable taking two :obj:`float` as arguments and
        returning an image as a :obj:`numpy.array`. **This argument is intended
        for use in the examples of Crappy, to apply an artificial strain on a
        base image. Most users should ignore it.** When given, the ``camera``
        argument is ignored and the images are acquired from the generator. To
        apply a strain on the image, strain values (in `%`) should be sent to
        the Camera Block over the labels ``'Exx(%)'`` and ``'Eyy(%)'``.
      labels: The labels to use for sending data to downstream Blocks. If not
        given, the default labels are ``'t(s)', 'meta'`` followed for each
        given patch by ``'p<i>x', 'p<i>y'`` with ``'<i>'`` the number of the
        patch. They carry for each image its timestamp, a :obj:`dict`
        containing its metadata, and then for each patch the `x` and `y`
        positions of its centroid. When setting this argument, make sure to
        give 2 labels for the time and the metadata, and two labels per patch.
      img_ref: A reference image, as a 2D :obj:`numpy.array` with `dtype`
        `float32`. If given, it will be set early on the correlation class and
        the test can start from the first acquired frame. If not given, the
        first acquired image will be set as the reference, which will slow down
        the beginning of the test.
      kernel_file: The path to the file containing the kernels to use for the
        correlation. Can be a :obj:`pathlib.Path` object or a :obj:`str`. If
        not provided, the default :ref:`GPU Kernels` are used.
      iterations: The maximum number of iterations to run before returning the
        results. The results may be returned before if the residuals start
        increasing.
      mul: The scalar by which the direction will be multiplied before being
        added to the solution. If it's too high, the convergence will be fast
        but there's a risk to go past the solution and to diverge. If it's too
        low, the convergence will be slower and require more iterations. `3`
        was found to be an acceptable value in most cases, but it is
        recommended to tune this value for each application so that the
        convergence is neither too slow nor too fast.
      **kwargs: Any additional argument will be passed to the
        :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera` object, and used as a kwarg to its
        :meth:`~crappy.camera.Camera.open` method.
