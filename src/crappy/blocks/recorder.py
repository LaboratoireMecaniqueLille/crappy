  from multiple Blocks, use several instances of Recorder (recommended) or a
  :class:`~crappy.blocks.Multiplexer` Block.
  
  This Block cannot directly record data from "streams", i.e. coming from an
  :class:`~crappy.blocks.IOBlock` Block with the ``'streamer'`` argument set to
  :obj:`True`. To do so, the :class:`~crappy.blocks.HDFRecorder` Block should
  be used instead. Alternatively, a :class:`~crappy.modifier.Demux` Modifier 
  can be placed between the IOBlock and the Recorder, but most of the acquired
  data won't be saved.
