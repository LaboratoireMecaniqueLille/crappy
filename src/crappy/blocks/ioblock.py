  """This Block is meant to drive :class:`~crappy.inout.InOut` objects. It can
  acquire data, and/or set commands. One IOBlock can only drive a single InOut.

  If it has incoming :class:`~crappy.links.Link`, it will set the commands 
  received over the labels given in ``cmd_labels`` by calling the 
  :meth:`~crappy.inout.InOut.set_cmd` method of the InOut. Additional commands 
  to set at the very beginning or the very end of the test can also be 
  specified.

  If it has outgoing :class:`~crappy.links.Link`, it will acquire data using 
  the :meth:`~crappy.inout.InOut.get_data` method of the InOut and send it
  downstream over the labels given in ``labels``. It is possible to trigger the
  acquisition using a predefined label.

  The ``streamer`` argument allows using the "streamer" mode of InOuts
  supporting it, instead of the regular acquisition mode. Finally, the
  ``make_zero_delay`` argument allows offsetting the acquired values to zero at
  the beginning of the test. Refer to the documentation of each argument for a
  more detailed description.

    """Sets the arguments and initializes the parent class.

    Args:
      name: The name of the :class:`~crappy.inout.InOut` class to instantiate.
      labels: An iterable (e.g. a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing the
        output labels for InOuts that acquire data. They correspond to the
        values returned by the InOut's :meth:`~crappy.inout.InOut.get_data`
        method, so there should be as many labels as returned values, and given
        in the appropriate order. The first label must always be the time
        label, preferably called ``'t(s)'``. This argument can be omitted if
        :meth:`~crappy.inout.InOut.get_data` returns a :obj:`dict`. Ignored if
        the Block has no output Link.
      cmd_labels: An iterable (e.g. a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) containing
        the labels considered as inputs of this Block, for InOuts that set
        commands. The values received from these labels will be passed to the
        InOut's :meth:`~crappy.inout.InOut.set_cmd` method, in the same order
        as the labels are given. Usually, time is not part of the
        ``cmd_labels``. Ignored if the Block has no input Link.
      trigger_label: If given, the Block will only read data whenever a value
        is received on this label (can be any value). Ignored if the Block has
        no output Link. A trigger label can also be a cmd label.
      streamer: If :obj:`False`, the :meth:`~crappy.inout.InOut.get_data`
        method of the InOut is called for acquiring data, else it is the
        :meth:`~crappy.inout.InOut.get_stream` method. Refer to the
        documentation of these methods for more information.
      initial_cmd: An initial command for the InOut, set during
        :meth:`prepare`. If given, there must be as many values as in
        ``cmd_labels``. Must be given as an iterable (e.g. a :obj:`list` or a
        :obj:`tuple`).
      exit_cmd: A final command for the InOut, set during :meth:`finish`. If
        given, there must be as many values as in ``cmd_labels``. Must be given
        as an iterable (e.g. a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`).
      make_zero_delay: If set, will acquire data before the beginning of the
        test and use it to offset all the labels to zero. The data will be
        acquired during the given number of seconds. Ignored if the Block has
        no output Links. Does not work for InOuts that acquire values other
        than numbers (:obj:`str` for example).
      spam: If :obj:`False`, the Block will call
        :meth:`~crappy.inout.InOut.set_cmd` on the InOut object only if the
        current command is different from the previous. Otherwise, it will call
        the method each time a command is received.
      freq: The target looping frequency for the Block. If :obj:`None`, loops 
        as fast as possible.
      display_freq: If :obj:`True`, displays the looping frequency of the
        Block while running.
      debug: If :obj:`True`, displays all the log messages including the
        :obj:`~logging.DEBUG` ones. If :obj:`False`, only displays the log
        messages with :obj:`~logging.INFO` level or higher. If :obj:`None`,
        disables logging for this Block.
      **kwargs: The arguments to be passed to the :class:`~crappy.inout.InOut`.
