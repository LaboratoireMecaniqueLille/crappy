    """Sets the arguments and initializes the parent class.

    Args:
      patches: An instance of the
        :class:`~crappy.tool.camera_config.config_tools.SpotsBoxes` class,
        containing the coordinates of the patches to track. This argument is
        passed to the :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not
        used in this class.
      method: The method to use to calculate the displacement. `Disflow` uses
        opencv's DISOpticalFlow and `Lucas Kanade` uses opencv's
        calcOpticalFlowPyrLK, while all other methods are based on a basic
        cross-correlation in the Fourier domain. `Pixel precision` calculates
        the displacement by getting the position of the maximum of the
        cross-correlation, and has thus a 1-pixel resolution. It is mainly
        meant for debugging. `Parabola` refines the result of
        `Pixel precision` by interpolating the neighborhood of the maximum, and
        has thus a sub-pixel resolution. This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not used in this
        class.
      alpha: Weight of the smoothness term in DISFlow, as a :obj:`float`. This
        argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not used in this
        class.
      delta: Weight of the color constancy term in DISFlow, as a :obj:`float`.
        This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not used in this
        class.
      gamma: Weight of the gradient constancy term in DISFlow , as a
        :obj:`float`. This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not used in this
        class.
      finest_scale: Finest level of the Gaussian pyramid on which the flow
        is computed in DISFlow (`0` means full scale), as an :obj:`int`. This
        argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not used in this
        class.
      iterations: Maximum number of gradient descent iterations in the
        patch inverse search stage in DISFlow, as an :obj:`int`. This argument
        is passed to the :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not
        used in this class.
      gradient_iterations: Maximum number of gradient descent iterations
        in the patch inverse search stage in DISFlow, as an :obj:`int`. This
        argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not used in this
        class.
      patch_size: Size of an image patch for matching in DISFlow
        (in pixels). This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not used in this
        class.
      patch_stride: Stride between neighbor patches in DISFlow. Must be
        less than patch size. This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not used in this
        class.
      border: Crop the patch on each side according to this value before
        calculating the displacements. 0 means no cropping, 1 means the entire
        patch is cropped. This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not used in this
        class.
      safe: If :obj:`True`, checks whether the patches aren't exiting the
        image, and raises an error if that's the case. This argument is passed
        to the :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not used in
        this class.
      follow: It :obj:`True`, the patches will move to follow the displacement
        of the image. This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DICVETool` and not used in this
        class.
      raise_on_exit: If :obj:`True`, raises an exception and stops the test
        when losing the patches. Otherwise, simply stops processing but lets 
        the test go on.
