        the coordinates of the ROI to perform DIS on. This argument is passed
        to the :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DISCorrelTool` and not used
        in this class.
      fields: The base of fields to use for the projection, given as a
        :obj:`list` of :obj:`str`. The available fields are :
        ::

          'x', 'y', 'r', 'exx', 'eyy', 'exy', 'eyx', 'exy2', 'z'

        This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DISCorrelTool` and not used in this

        argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DISCorrelTool` and not used in this

        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DISCorrelTool` and not used in this

      gamma: Weight of the gradient constancy term in DISFlow , as a
        :obj:`float`. This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DISCorrelTool` and not used in this
        class.
      finest_scale: Finest level of the Gaussian pyramid on which the flow
        is computed in DISFlow (`0` means full scale), as an :obj:`int`. This
        argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DISCorrelTool` and not used in this
        class.
      init: If :obj:`True`, the last field is used to initialize the
        calculation for the next one. This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DISCorrelTool` and not used in this
        class.
      iterations: Maximum number of gradient descent iterations in the
        patch inverse search stage in DISFlow, as an :obj:`int`. This argument
        is passed to the :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DISCorrelTool` and

        (in pixels). This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DISCorrelTool` and not used in this
        class.
      patch_stride: Stride between neighbor patches in DISFlow. Must be
        less than patch size. This argument is passed to the
        :obj:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.DISCorrelTool` and not used in this
