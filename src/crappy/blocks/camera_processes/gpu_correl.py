    """Sets the arguments and initializes the parent class.
    
    Args:
      discard_limit: If ``calc_res`` is :obj:`True`, the result of the
        correlation is not sent to the downstream Blocks if the residuals for
        the current image are greater than ``discard_limit`` times the average
        residual for the last ``discard_ref`` images.
      discard_ref: If ``calc_res`` is :obj:`True`, the result of the
        correlation is not sent to the downstream Blocks if the residuals for
        the current image are greater than ``discard_limit`` times the average
        residual for the last ``discard_ref`` images.
      calc_res: If :obj:`True`, calculates the residuals after performing the
        correlation and returns the residuals along with the correlation data.
        By default, the residuals are returned under the label ``'res'``.
      img_ref: A reference image for the correlation, given as a 2D
        :obj:`numpy.array` with `dtype` :obj:`numpy.float32`. If not given, the
        first acquired frame will be used as the reference image instead. This
        argument is passed to the
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.GPUCorrelTool` and not used in
        this class.
      verbose: The verbose level as an integer, between `0` and `3`. At level
        `0` no information is displayed, and at level `3` so much information
        is displayed that it slows the code down. This argument is passed to
        the :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.GPUCorrelTool` and not used
        in this class.
      levels: Number of levels of the pyramid. More levels may help converging
        on images with large strain, but may fail on images that don't contain
        low spatial frequency. Fewer levels mean that the program runs faster.
        This argument is passed to  the
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.GPUCorrelTool` and not used in
        this class.
      resampling_factor: The factor by which the resolution is divided between
        each stage of the pyramid. A low factor ensures coherence between the
        stages, but is more computationally intensive. A high factor allows
        reaching a finer detail level, but may lead to a coherence loss between
        the stages. This argument is passed to the
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.GPUCorrelTool` and not used in
        this class.
      kernel_file: The path to the file containing the kernels to use for the
        correlation. Can be a :obj:`pathlib.Path` object or a :obj:`str`. If
        not provided, the default :ref:`GPU Kernels` are used. This argument is
        passed to the :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.GPUCorrelTool` and
        not used in this class.
      iterations: The maximum number of iterations to run before returning the
        results. The results may be returned before if the residuals start
        increasing. This argument is passed to the
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.GPUCorrelTool` and not used in
        this class.
      fields: A :obj:`list` of :obj:`str` representing the base of fields on
        which the image will be projected during correlation. The possible
        fields are :
        ::

          'x', 'y', 'r', 'exx', 'eyy', 'exy', 'eyx', 'exy2', 'z'

        This argument is passed to the
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.GPUCorrelTool` and not used in
        this class.
      mask: The mask used for weighting the region of interest on the image. It
        is generally used to prevent unexpected behavior on the border of the
        image. This argument is passed to the
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.GPUCorrelTool` and not used in
        this class.
      mul: The scalar by which the direction will be multiplied before being
        added to the solution. If it's too high, the convergence will be fast
        but there's a risk to go past the solution and to diverge. If it's too
        low, the convergence will be slower and require more iterations. `3`
        was found to be an acceptable value in most cases, but it is
        recommended to tune this value for each application so that the
        convergence is neither too slow nor too fast. This argument is passed
        to the :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.GPUCorrelTool` and not
        used in this class.
