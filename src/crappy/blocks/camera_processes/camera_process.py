  """This :obj:`~multiprocessing.Process` is the base class for all the helper
  Processes of the :class:`~crappy.blocks.Camera` Block.
  
  It defines a base architecture that all the children classes use, and on top
  of which they add the specific actions they perform. This class is not meant 
  to be instantiated as is, it should always be subclassed.
  
  This class and its children can be seen as a tool for the 
  :class:`~crappy.blocks.Camera` Block and its children. Several instances can
  be started by the Camera Block, each instance performing a different action
  with the acquired images. This allows to parallelize image acquisition, 
  display, processing and recording on multiple CPU cores, to increase the 
  achieved FPS.
  
  The Camera Block performs the acquisition, and makes the latest captured
  image available to all the CameraProcess :obj:`~multiprocessing.Process` 
  through an :obj:`~multiprocessing.Array`. They are then free to run at their
  own rhythm, but are sure to always grab the latest available frame.
  
  The instantiation, startup and termination of the CameraProcesses is all
  managed by the parent :class:`~crappy.blocks.Camera` Block, depending on the
  provided arguments. Users should normally not need to call this class
  themselves.
