  """This Block is meant to drive one or several
  :class:`~crappy.actuator.Actuator`. It can set speed or position commands on
  hardware actuators.

  The possibility to drive several Actuators from a unique Block is given so
  that they can be driven in a synchronized way. If synchronization is not
  needed, it is preferable to drive the Actuators from separate Machine Blocks.

  This Block takes the speed or position commands for the Actuators  as inputs,
  and can optionally read and output the current speed and/or positions of the
  Actuators. The speed and position commands are set respectively by calling
  the :meth:`~crappy.actuator.Actuator.set_position` and
  :meth:`~crappy.actuator.Actuator.set_speed` methods of the Actuators, and the
  current speed and position values are acquired by calling the
  :meth:`~crappy.actuator.Actuator.get_position` and
  :meth:`~crappy.actuator.Actuator.get_speed` methods of the Actuators.

  It is possible to tune for each Actuator the label over which it receives its
  commands, and optionally the labels over which it sends its current speed
  and/or position. The driving mode (`'speed'` or `'position'`) can also be set
  independently for each Actuator.

      actuators: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) of all the

        contains one :obj:`dict` for every Actuator, with mandatory and 
        optional keys. The keys providing information on how to drive the 
        Actuator are listed below. Any other unrecognized key will be passed to 
        the Actuator as argument when instantiating it.
      common: The keys of this :obj:`dict` will be common to all the Actuators.
        If one key conflicts with an existing key for an Actuator, the common 
        one will prevail.
      time_label: If reading speed or position from one or more Actuators, the
        time information will be carried by this label.
      spam: If :obj:`True`, a command is sent to the Actuators at each loop of
        the Block, else it is sent every time a new command is received.
      freq: The target looping frequency for the Block. If :obj:`None`, loops 
        as fast as possible.
      display_freq: If :obj:`True`, displays the looping frequency of the
        Block.
      debug: If :obj:`True`, displays all the log messages including the
        :obj:`~logging.DEBUG` ones. If :obj:`False`, only displays the log
        messages with :obj:`~logging.INFO` level or higher. If :obj:`None`,
        disables logging for this Block.

    Note:
      - ``actuators`` keys:

        - ``type``: The name of the :class:`~crappy.actuator.Actuator` class to 
          instantiate. This key is mandatory.
        - ``cmd_label``: The label carrying the command for driving the
          Actuator. It defaults to `'cmd'`.
        - ``mode``: Can be either `'speed'` or `'position'`. Either
          :meth:`~crappy.actuator.Actuator.set_speed` or
          :meth:`~crappy.actuator.Actuator.set_position` is called to drive the
          Actuator, depending on the selected mode. When driven in `'position'` 
          mode, the speed of the actuator can also be adjusted, see the 
          ``speed`` and ``speed_cmd_label`` keys. The default mode is 
          `'speed'`.
        - ``speed``: If mode is `'position'`, the speed at which the Actuator
          should move. This speed is passed as second argument to the
          :meth:`~crappy.actuator.Actuator.set_position` method of the
          Actuator. If the ``speed_cmd_label`` key is not specified, this speed
          will remain the same for the entire test. This key is not mandatory.
        - ``position_label``: If given, the Block will return the value of
          :meth:`~crappy.actuator.Actuator.get_position` under this label. This
          key is not mandatory.
        - ``speed_label``: If given, the Block will return the value of
          :meth:`~crappy.actuator.Actuator.get_speed` under this label. This
          key is not mandatory.
        - ``speed_cmd_label``: The label carrying the speed to set when driving
          in `'position'` mode. Each time a value is received, the stored speed
          value is updated. It will also overwrite the ``speed`` key if given.
