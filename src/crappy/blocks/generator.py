    Args:
      path: It must be a :obj:`list` of :obj:`dict`, each dict providing the
        parameters to generate the path. Refer to the Note below for more
        information.
      freq: The looping frequency this block will try to achieve. Note that the
        higher this value, the more accurate the path will be. It will also
        consume more resources.
      cmd_label: The label of the signal sent to the downstream blocks.
      cycle_label: In addition to the `cmd_label`, this label holds the index
        of the current dict in the ``path`` list. Useful to trig a block  upon
        change in the current dict.
      repeat: If :obj:`True`, the ``path`` will loop forever instead of
        stopping when the list of dicts is exhausted.
      spam: If :obj:`True`, the signal value will be sent on each loop. Else,
        it will only be sent if it is different from the previous or if the
        ``path`` switched to a new dict.
      display_freq: if :obj:`True`, displays the loop frequency of the block
        and a message when switching to the next dict of ``path``.
      end_delay: When all the dicts in ``path`` are exhausted, waits this many
        seconds before stopping the entire program. Can be set to :obj:`None`,
        in which case the Generator won't stop the program when finishing.
      safe_start: Ensures the first dict in ``path`` waits for at least one
        data point from upstream blocks before sending the first value of the
        signal. Otherwise, the first value might be sent without checking the
        associated condition if its depends on labels from other blocks.

    Note:
      The different types of signals that can be generated by the Generator
      can be found at `generator path`. The ``path`` list contains one dict per
      signal shape to generate. They are generated in the order in which they
      appear in the list.

      Each dict contains information on the signal shape to generate, like its
      type, any applicable parameter(s), and the stop condition(s). Refer to
      the documentation of each signal shape to which information to give.
