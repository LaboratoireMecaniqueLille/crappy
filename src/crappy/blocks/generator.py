  The generated signal is just a waveform that can serve any purpose. It can
  for example be used for driving a :class:`~crappy.blocks.Machine` Block, or 
  for triggering a :class:`~crappy.blocks.Camera` Block.

  One Generator Block can only generate one signal. Use multiple Blocks if
  several signals are needed. Note that the default behavior of a Generator
  is to stop the entire script when it reaches the end of all the Paths.

  This Block can also accept inputs from other Blocks, as these inputs may be
  used by a :class:`~crappy.blocks.generator_path.meta_path.Path`. The most
  common use of this feature is to have the stop condition of a Path depend on
  the received values of a label.

    Args:
      path: An iterable (like a :obj:`list` or a :obj:`tuple`) of :obj:`dict`,
        each dict providing the parameters to generate a 
        :class:`~crappy.blocks.generator_path.meta_path.Path`. The Paths are
        generated in the order in which they are given, and the stop condition
        of each Path is used for determining when to switch to the next one.
      freq: The target looping frequency for the Block. If :obj:`None`, loops 
        as fast as possible.
      cmd_label: The label of the signal sent to the downstream Blocks.
      cycle_label: In addition to the ``cmd_label``, this label holds the index
        of the current :class:`~crappy.blocks.generator_path.meta_path.Path`.
        Useful to trigger a Block when the current Path changes, as the output
        value might not necessarily change.
      repeat: If :obj:`True`, the ``path`` will loop forever instead of
        stopping when it reaches the last Path.
      spam: If :obj:`True`, the signal value will be sent on each loop. Else,
        it will only be sent if it is different from the previous or if the
        Block switched to the next Path.
      display_freq: if :obj:`True`, displays the looping frequency of the 
        Block.
      end_delay: When all the Paths are exhausted, waits this many seconds
        before stopping the entire script. Can be set to :obj:`None`,
        in which case the Generator won't stop the program when finishing.
      safe_start: Ensures the first Path waits for at least one data point from
        upstream Blocks before sending the first value of the signal.
        Otherwise, the first value might be sent without checking the
        associated condition if its depends on labels from other Blocks.
      debug: If :obj:`True`, displays all the log messages including the
        :obj:`~logging.DEBUG` ones. If :obj:`False`, only displays the log
        messages with :obj:`~logging.INFO` level or higher. If :obj:`None`,
        disables logging for this Block.
