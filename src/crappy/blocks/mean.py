  """This Block can compute the average values of given labels over a given 
  delay.

  It can take any number of inputs, provided that they share a common time
  label. If the same label (except time) is received from several Blocks, it
  may lead to unexpected results.
  
  The output of this Block is very similar to that of the 
  :class:`~crappy.modifier.Mean` and :class:`~crappy.modifier.MovingAvg` 
  Modifiers, but not exactly similar. While these Modifiers calculate the 
  average of a label over a fixed number of data points, the MeanBlock 
  calculates the average of the values received over a given delay. This 
  behavior could, however, also be achieved using a 
  :class:`~crappy.modifier.Modifier`.

  Warning:
    If the delay for averaging is too short compared with the looping frequency
    of the upstream Blocks, this Block may not always return the same number of
    labels ! This can cause errors in downstream Blocks expecting a fixed
    number of labels.
