    Args:
      white_spots: If :obj:`True`, detects white spots over a black background.
        If :obj:`False`, detects black spots over a white background. Also
        passed to the 
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.video_extenso.VideoExtensoTool`.
      num_spots: The number of spots to detect, as an :obj:`int` between `1`
        and `4`. If given, will try to detect exactly that number of spots and
        will fail if not enough spots can be detected. If left to :obj:`None`,
        will detect up to `4` spots, but potentially fewer.
      min_area: The minimum area an object should have to be potentially
        detected as a spot. The value is given in pixels, as a surface unit.
        It must of course be adapted depending on the resolution of the camera
        and the size of the spots to detect.
      blur: An :obj:`int`, odd and greater than `1`, defining the size of the
        kernel to use when applying a median blur filter to the image before
        trying to detect spots. Can also be set to :obj:`None`, in which case
        no median blur filter is applied before detecting the spots. Also
        passed to the 
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.video_extenso.VideoExtensoTool`.
      update_thresh: If :obj:`True`, the grey level threshold for detecting
        the spots is re-calculated at each new image. Otherwise, the first
        calculated threshold is kept for the entire test. The spots are less
        likely to be lost with adaptive threshold, but the measurement will be
        more noisy. Adaptive threshold may also yield inconsistent results when
        spots are lost. Passed to the 
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.video_extenso.VideoExtensoTool` 
        and not used in this class.
      safe_mode: If :obj:`True`, will stop and raise an exception as soon as
        overlapping spots are detected. Otherwise, will first try to reduce the
        detection window to get rid of overlapping. This argument should be
        used when inconsistency in the results may have critical consequences.
        Passed to the 
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.video_extenso.VideoExtensoTool` 
        and not used in this class.
      border: When searching for the new position of a spot, will search in the
        last known bounding box of this spot plus a few additional pixels in
        each direction. This argument sets the number of additional pixels to
        use. It should be greater than the expected "speed" of the spots, in
        pixels / frame. But if set too high, noise or other spots might hinder
        the detection. Passed to the 
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.video_extenso.VideoExtensoTool` 
        and not used in this class.
