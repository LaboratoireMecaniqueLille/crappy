class VideoExtensoTool:
  """This class is the core of the :class:`~crappy.blocks.VideoExtenso` Block.

  It performs spot tracking on up to `4` spots on the images acquired by the
  :class:`~crappy.camera.Camera`, and computes the strain values at each new 
  image. For each spot, the tracking is performed by an independent
  :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.video_extenso.tracker.tracker.Tracker`
  Process.

  It is possible to track only one spot, in which case only the position of its
  center is returned and the strain values are left to `0`.

    Args:
      spots: An instance of the 
        :class:`~crappy.tool.camera_config.config_tools.SpotsBoxes` tool 
        containing the coordinates of the spots to track.
      thresh: The grey level value of the threshold to use for discriminating
        spots from the background, as an :obj:int`. Passed to the
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.video_extenso.tracker.Tracker`
        and not used in this class.
      log_level: The minimum logging level of the entire Crappy script, as an
        :obj:`int`.
      log_queue: A :obj:`multiprocessing.Queue` for sending the log messages to 
        the main :obj:`~logging.Logger`, only used in Windows.
      white_spots: If :obj:`True`, detects white objects over a black
        background, else black objects over a white background. Passed to the
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.video_extenso.tracker.Tracker`
        and not used in this class.
      update_thresh: If :obj:`True`, the grey level threshold for detecting the
        spots is re-calculated at each new image. Otherwise, the first
        calculated threshold is kept for the entire test. The spots are less
        likely to be lost with adaptive threshold, but the measurement will be
        more noisy. Adaptive threshold may also yield inconsistent results when
        spots are lost. Passed to the 
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.video_extenso.tracker.Tracker`
        and not used in this class.
      safe_mode: If :obj:`True`, the class will stop and raise an exception as
        soon as overlapping spots are detected. Otherwise, it will first try to
        reduce the detection window to get rid of overlapping. This argument
        should be used when inconsistency in the results may have critical
        consequences.
      border: When searching for the new position of a spot, the class will
        search in the last known bounding box of this spot plus a few
        additional pixels in each direction. This argument sets the number of
        additional pixels to use. It should be greater than the expected
        "speed" of the spots, in pixels / frame. But if it's set too high,
        noise or other spots might hinder the detection. Passed to the
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.video_extenso.tracker.Tracker`
        and not used in this class.
      blur: The size in pixels (as an odd :obj:`int` greater than `1`) of the
        kernel to use when applying a median blur filter to the image before
        the spot detection. If not given, no blurring is performed. A slight 
        blur improves the spot detection by smoothening the noise, but also 
        takes a bit more time compared to no blurring. Passed to the 
        :class:`~crappy.tool.image_processing.video_extenso.tracker.Tracker`
        and not used in this class.
