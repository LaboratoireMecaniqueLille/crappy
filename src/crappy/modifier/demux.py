  """Modifier converting a stream into a regular data flow interpretable by
  most Blocks.

  It is meant to be used on a :class:`~crappy.links.Link` taking an
  :class:`~crappy.blocks.IOBlock` in streamer mode as an input. It converts
  the stream to make it readable by most Blocks, and also splits the stream in
  several labels if necessary.

  It takes a stream as an input, i.e. a :obj:`dict` whose values are numpy
  arrays, and outputs another :obj:`dict` whose values are :obj:`float`. If the
  numpy arrays contains several columns (corresponding to several acquired
  channels), it splits them into several labels.

  Important:
    In the process of converting the stream data to regular labeled data, much
    information is lost ! This Modifier is intended to format the stream data
    for low-frequency plotting, or low-frequency decision-making. To save all
    the stream data, use the :class:`~crappy.blocks.HDFRecorder` Block.
