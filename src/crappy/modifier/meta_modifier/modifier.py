  The Modifiers allow altering data from an input :class:`~crappy.blocks.Block`

  :class:`~crappy.links.Link` linking the two Blocks. It is passed as an
  argument of the :meth:`~crappy.link` method instantiating the Link.

  It is preferable for every Modifier to be a child of this class, although
  that is not mandatory. A Modifier only needs to be a callable, i.e. a class
