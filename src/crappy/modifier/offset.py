  constant is calculated so that for each label the first returned value is
  equal to a user-defined target.

  For example if for a given label the target is `6` and the first received
  value is `3`, the Modifier will add `3` to each value received over this
  label.

  This Modifier can be used for example when measuring a variable that should
  start at `0` but doesn't because of a sensor offset. It can also just be used
  to plot nicer figures. It is not very accurate as it is only based on a
  single data point for the offset calculation. The ``make_zero`` argument of
  the :class:`~crappy.blocks.IOBlock` is a better alternative if precision is
  required when offsetting a sensor.
